The project involves creating an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to extract GDP information from a Wikipedia page, transform it into a more usable format, and load it into both a CSV file and a SQLite database. Additionally, the code should run a query on the database to filter out countries with GDPs exceeding 100 billion USD and log the entire process in a separate log file.

*Data Extraction*: The first step is to extract the relevant GDP information from the provided URL. This can be achieved using web scraping techniques, such as using libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to parse the HTML content of the webpage and extract the necessary data.

*Data Transformation*: Once the data is extracted, it needs to be transformed into the required format. In this case, the GDP values are in million USD, and they need to be converted to billion USD (rounded to 2 decimal places). This transformation can be done using simple arithmetic operations.

*Data Loading*: After transformation, the data needs to be loaded into both a CSV file and a SQLite database. The CSV file can be created using Python's built-in CSV module or the pandas library. For the SQLite database, the data can be loaded using SQLite3 library, and a database file named World_Economies.db with a table named Countries_by_GDP can be created.

*Query Execution*: Once the data is loaded into the database, a query needs to be executed to filter out countries with GDPs exceeding 100 billion USD. This can be done using SQL queries executed through Python's SQLite3 library.

*Logging*: Throughout the entire process, it's important to log the progress and any relevant information. This can be achieved using Python's logging module, which allows for logging messages with appropriate timestamps.

Overall, the ETL pipeline involves a series of steps including extraction, transformation, loading, query execution, and logging to achieve the desired outcome of providing GDP information in both CSV and database formats while filtering out countries with GDPs exceeding 100 billion USD.
